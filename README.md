## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. **Statistical Tests**
- **Z-Test** and **T-Test** were used to analyze differences in performance across various groups.  

### 2. **Normality Tests**
To ensure that the data follows a **normal distribution**, the following methods were applied:
- **Q-Q Plot** 📈  
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**  
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**  
- **Box Plot** 📊  
- **Histogram Chart**  

### 3. **Data Processing**
- **Data Cleansing**: Handled missing or inconsistent data.  
- **Data Transformation**: Prepared the data for statistical analysis.  

### 4. **Data Analysis**
- Analyzed key statistics:  
  - **Mean**  
  - **Minimum**  
  - **Maximum**  
  - **Standard Deviation (std)**
